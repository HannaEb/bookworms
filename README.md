Bookworms was developed as a project during the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) web development course.

Bookworms aims to remove the admin involved when organising a book club with your friends - or with anyone at all! Now you can find your the perfect club for you, based on genre, location, or time - or if you can't find one you like, create your own.

This project was built using Rails to serve an API, with the user interface being created in Angular.
